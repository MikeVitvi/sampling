# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

The purpose of this survey is to understand the reasons behind the high turnover rate among entry- and lower-level employees in our tech company. The insights gained will help identify key factors affecting employee satisfaction and guide the implementation of improvements to retain talent.

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:

**Target Population:** Entry- and lower-level employees who have left the company in the past six months, as well as current employees in these positions.

**Sampling Frame:** Employee records and contact information for those who have recently left the company, along with a current list of entry- and lower-level employees.

**Sampling Units:** Individual employees, both former and current, from the identified positions.

**Overall Sampling Strategy:** We will use a stratified random sampling method. This involves dividing the target population into two strata: former employees and current employees. Within each stratum, we will randomly select participants to ensure a representative sample of both groups. This strategy allows us to compare perspectives from those who have left and those who are still with the company.

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. What was your primary reason for leaving the company?
2. How satisfied are you with your current role in the company?
3. What factors contribute most to your job satisfaction?
4. How often did/do you feel stressed at work?
5. How would you rate the support and resources provided by the company to help you succeed in your role?
6. How likely are you to recommend this company as a good place to work to your friends and colleagues?
7. How effective do you find the communication within your team and with management?
8. write your question here... (optional)
